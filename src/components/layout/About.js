          Hi! My name is Evgeniy Burbyga , but you can call me Jay (my wife and
          mom calling me that). I am 28 years old, was born in the Ukraine ,
          moved to Israel with my family at the age of 6 , and then moved to
          Canada with my wife in 2017. I have a cat named Muffin and I play
          drums since 2004.

          <br />
          My passion for coding started about 3 years ago. As any passion or
          hobby in my life, the passion for coding rose out of the satisfaction
          of getting various problems solved, creating something new and
          figuring out the “how to” for any challenge that I encounter.
          Researching and learning how to overcome a road block excites me with
          anticipation of acquiring new knowledge. Learning to code helped me
          realize that most of my interests were driven by and revolved around
          the same base concept of my passion: whether it was to build something
          visual and operational from construction assembly toys, or forming a
          music band and writing music, or disassembling and trying to fix
          things (like an old phone or a laptop) before discarding them, or
          experimenting with raspberry pi mini computer. My passion became my
          way of life. I was learning to code every bit of my free time, even
          when working 12h/6d a week shifts. However, I felt it was not enough.
          Fortunately, I got a chance to work on a few small projects with my
          cousin, who was a senior full stack developer at that time. I saw this
          as an opportunity to test my passion for coding and whether or not I
          will get as much satisfaction when coding for someone with strict
          demands as I was getting when I was coding for my own enjoyment. This
          experience not only proved my passion for coding but also gave the
          meaning to it. After moving to Ottawa, I fed my interest in coding
          through regularly going to almost every available coding meetup or
          workshop. Meeting and talking to new people from the industry gave me
          the feeling that it was time to transform my passion into a
          profession.
