        Hi! My name is Evgeniy Burbyga ,
        but you can call me Jay (my wife and mom calling me that).
        I am 28 years old, was born in the Ukraine , moved to Israel with my family at the age of 6 ,
        and then moved to Canada with my wife in 2017. I have a cat named Muffin and I play drums since 2004.
<br />
        <br />
        <b className="about-title" style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}> Early life: </b><br />
        Before I entered the big web development world ,
        I was a professional truck driver, and web development was a side hobby that I really enjoyed.
        I was teaching my self to code with FreeCodeCamp and Odin's Project while working 12hr/6day shifts(yeah, no life).
        But I really enjoyed that I needed to use my brain a lot, and that I actually can build stuff that I can show or even just explain.
        With that, Somewhere along the way this hobby became a passion, and the fillings and thinking, a way of life .
        Then I realized that learning and developing my self is the thing that keeps my gears going.
<br />
        <br />
        <b className="about-title" style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>What I am up to now :</b><br />

        As the quote on top of this page says, I am trying to be better then tomorrow me , I'm constantly learning and self developing.<br />
        I'm always open for new challenging, hard and interesting projects! so if you have them, count me in !!! </p>
